    <p>Write some code that evolves generations through the "game of  life".</p>
    <p>The input will be a game board of cells, either alive (1) or dead (0).</p>
    <p>The code should take this board and create a new board for the next generation based on the following rules:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies (underpopulation)</li>
        <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation (survival)</li>
        <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies (overcrowding)</li>
        <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell (reproduction)</li>
